## Getting started

### Dependencies

Run `yarn` on root folder to install dependencies related to Express.

cd `client` and run `yarn install` dependencies related to React.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `yarn start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd` client and run `yarn start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
- Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 5000
- You can test your client app in `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000`
